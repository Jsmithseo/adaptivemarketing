              Chris Curnutt is originally from Oklahoma and began his golf
              journey at 5 years old in a suburb of Tulsa. He grew up playing
              multiple sports, including soccer and baseball, but decided at the
              age of 15 to focus on golf. In high school, Chris was a member of
              his High School team which amassed over 25 wins, including 3
              consecutive Oklahoma State Championships. After attending the
              University of Arkansas with a major in Education, Chris began his
              career in golf at Shadow Valley CC in Bentonville, AR. Here, he
              was involved in the instruction program as well as day to day
              operations. He continued his career at Emerald Falls GC in Broken
              Arrow, OK, as an Assistant Professional. After moving to the
              Oklahoma City area, Chris instructed on a part time basis while
              pursuing a career in restaurant management. 10 years later, Chris
              and his girlfriend Samantha moved to Northern California and the
              decision was made that he would return to teaching full time.
              Chris is currently an instructor at Blue Rock Springs GC in
              Vallejo, CA

                    Chris Curnutt's teaching style is characterized by a deep
                    passion for golf and a commitment to holistic development.
                    Drawing from a wealth of experience, he focuses on
                    cultivating a strong foundation in his students, emphasizing
                    not only technical skills but also core values. As an
                    instructor, Chris leverages a diverse set of tools and
                    techniques to enhance learning. He utilizes Operation 36, V1
                    video analysis, and Hackmotion technology to provide
                    structured and goal-oriented lessons. This combination of
                    tools allows him to offer precise feedback and tailored
                    guidance to his students.
